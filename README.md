# dont-die
Don't Die is a retro-style 2D platforming video game created fully using MIPS Assembly. It takes advantage of certain locations of memory to display pixels on a Bitmap Display as well as read keyboard inputs live. I also created and used a Python script to convert 64x64 png files into arrays of hexadecimal values so I could easily create artwork and stages and implement them into the game.

Don't Die features enemies that shoot projectiles, collectible coins, 3 stages + 1 bonus stage unlocked after collecting all 3 coins, cheats, and more. The player moves left and right, and has the ability to jump to navigate obstacles and platforms.
